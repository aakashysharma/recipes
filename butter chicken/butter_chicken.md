# Butter Chicken

### for 2 persons


## Marination
- Take the chicken pieces, preferably cut them into smaller pieces of size not bigger than 8 cm in length.
- Put chicken pieces in a bowl
- Sprinkle salt (as per requirement)
- Sprinkle Kashmiri Chilli powder (according to your taste)
- 1 spoon of ginger garlic paste OR fine chopped pieces of garlic and ginger
- Sprinkle coriander power (about 1 teaspoon full, you can go upto 2)
- Mix the mixture with hands for proper marination or with spoon, make sure all the chicken surface is covered.
- Leave it in a fridge for at least 1 hour

## Chicken pieces
- Take vegetable oil in a pan
- Heat it up
- Add marinated chicken pieces to the pan so that they are not on top of each other, do it in batches if needed
- Reduce the heat to medium
- Let them cook for about 5-8 minutes on one side without flipping them
- Flip to cook from the other side
- The chicken pieces should have slightly brown/black texture and not just plain white
- Take them out and keep aside
- Don't throw away/clean the pan

## Curry
- Take the same pan, add a bit of oil, put pan on medium high heat
- Add 50gm butter and chopped onions, one small-medium onion is enough
- Mix it while butter is melting
- Scrape the residue from frying chicken earlier with melted butter and let it mix
- Add 2-3 cardamom
- Mix it
- Add 1/10 of tea spoon turmeric (kurkuma)
- Add half tea spoon of coriander powder
- Add kashmiri chilli powder according to your taste, can be added later too
- Add chopped tomatoes (4-6 tomatoes), only cut tomatoes in 4 pieces or can of tomatoes or puree
- Add a cup of water
- Put heat to medium and cover the lid
- Let it cook for 10 minutes
- Stir in between
- Turn off the heat after 10 minutes
- Let it cool down a bit
- Either use hand-blender or jar blender to blend the mixture
- Use a sieve to filter this liquid into other container
- Use spoon to extract maximum out of this mixture
- Tomato seeds, skin and other larger pieces are filtered out and we are left with creamy liquid

## Final steps
- Add very little amount of oil in a heated pan
- Add 20 gm of butter
- Turn the heat down to simmer
- Add the filtered fine liquid you prepared earlier
- Mix it well
- Check the consistency of the liquid, it should be creamy but not too thick
- Also check for salt and chilliness, add if needed (remember that the chicken pieces already have a bit of salt in them)
- Add a bit of cream (20% fat) and stir
- Check the consistency again, you can add more cream or butter to have the desired texture and color
- Cream makes it a bit thick, so avoid using more than 100mL of cream
- Add the chicken pieces prepared earlier and cover with the lid
- Leave it to cook with covered lid for 7-8 minutes
- Eat
